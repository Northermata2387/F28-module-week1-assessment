// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

// // Using alt and arrow keys you can easily move each step into the correct order
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
// const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 


// CODE HERE

// Using a variable declaration create a variable name matching one of the steps in the Software Development Lifecycle.
// Then have that variable declaration and variable name equal a relative string that provides the definition in the form of a string.
// Create each variable declaration in the order of operations they are performed.
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "We then gather all the specific details required for a new system as well as determining the first ideas for prototypes."
const requirements = "From the analysis we create a software requirement specification that include software, hardware, and network requirements for the system they plan to build"
const design = "First outline the details for the overall application, alongside specific aspects such as User interfaces, System interfaces, Network and network requirements, and Databases. "
const implementation = "We then collaborate and different modules or designs will be integrated into the primary source code through developer efforts, usually by leveraging training environments to detect further errors or defects."
const testingAndIntegrationn = "During testing we'll go over their software with a fine-tooth comb, noting any bugs or defects that need to be tracked, fixed, and later retested. The system will be integrated into its environment and eventually installed. After passing this stage, the software is theoretically ready for market and may be provided to any end-users. "
const maintain = "We now move into a maintenance mode and begin practicing any activities required to handle issues reported by end-users. Then we are responsible for implementing any changes that the software might need after deployment."
